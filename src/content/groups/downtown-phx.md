# About

We're a new-ish group for folks in the Downtown or Uptown Phoenix area. Most of us are programmers but we're open to anyone joining us!

## When We Meet

Usually on Tuesdays for 2-3 hours (i.e. 9-11am) a few times per month.

## Where We Meet

Typically we meet at [The McKinley Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JT6Ze7JsMukfg2Vd8) which is a coworking space downtown. You don't need to be a member to come to our coworking space. There is plenty of parking, coffee, water and tea.
