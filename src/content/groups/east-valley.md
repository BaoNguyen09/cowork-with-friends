# About

Don't work from home, come spend the day co-working with other people at HeatSync Labs in downtown Mesa.

Our mission: build shared community for the remote workers of Phoenix.

We are the OG coffee & co-working group in Phoenix (est. 2011), and we're made of software & hardware devs, graphic & UX designers, technical product managers, devop engineers, and more. Our experience ranges from unexperienced to professional veterans -- come join us!

Can't wait to see you.

Oh, and we also do Beer.js after which is post-coworking social time.

## When We Meet

Usually on Wednesdays at 9:00AM
