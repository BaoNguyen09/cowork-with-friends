# About

Join us for our weekly "Co-Working with Friends" meetup, an initiative by Saasphx designed to unite the Phoenix SaaS community in a productive yet social setting. Every Wednesday, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, we offer a unique opportunity for anyone involved in the SaaS industry to come together, work on their projects, and exchange industry insights and tips. Whether you're deep in the trenches of development, strategizing your next big move, or simply want to soak in the atmosphere of collective progress, this meetup is for you.
