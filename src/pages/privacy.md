        <h1>Privacy</h1>
        <p>This isn't some sort of official policy, but I did think it was worth it to share what type of data we collect, how it's used, etc.
        <p>Basically, you fill out the form with some information like email, zipcode, etc.</p>
        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>As of February 6, 2024, we use your email to communicate with you via a Google Group (which you get added to) and for sending you calendar events. Your email will show up in the invite list for coworking sessions so other members of the group will be able to see it.</p>
        <h3>Zipcode</h3>
        <p>We use your zipcode to get a sense of where people live in the city with the hopes that we can create hyper-local groups i.e. 85251 for South Scottsdale. Currently, your zipcode is kept privately and not shared with anyone. Though if we notice a large influx of people in a specific zipcode, we may try to connect them to start a new group.</p>
