# Starting a New Group

The first thing we want to say is AWESOME! We're so excited to hear you want to start a Cowork With Friends group local to your city. It's going to be one of the best things you do this year ðŸŽ‰

## Step One: Plan Your First Session

Pick a date, time and location for your first coworking session. Many groups choose Wednesdays because it's the middle of the week (less likely for people to be traveling) and helps break up the work week for many remote workers.

For time, we suggest doing a 2-3hr block. This way, it feels more casual and people don't have to arrive right when it starts.

For location, the ideal coworking place has:

- easy parking
- outlets
- decent wifi

That's pretty much it! Oh, and create a calendar event for it. This is the format we suggest for the event description (but feel free to use your own):

```text
Host: <Your Name>

Location:

<Short description - We'll probably grab a big table
near a booth inside. There's also some nice seating outside.>

Parking: <If parking isn't obvious, give directions>
```

And for the title we suggest calling it "Cowork With Friends"

## Step Two: Promote It on Socials

Now, to get the word out. We suggest finding one friend locally who can commit to attending. If you can't find one, that's okay.

Use whichever social network works best for you and your community. We've found success promoting on Twitter and LinkedIn.

Once you're at this stage, reach out to us at hello@coworkwithfriends.com and we'll help you promote!

## Step Three: Be a Good Host at the Event

Greet everyone. When a new person shows up, introduce that person to everyone else.

"Hey everyone, this is Joe!"

And take a picture (either together smiling as a group or candid) so we can use it when we add your group to the website.

## After the Event

Reach out to us at hello@coworkwithfriends.com and let us know how it went!

We'll then discuss next steps for helping you create a Google Group email list and adding the group to the website.
